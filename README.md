## 🧠 About Me

- 💼 Software Engineer driven by a deep love for problem-solving.
- 🏞️ Obsessed with mountain adventures — because nothing clears the mind like altitude and bad cell signal.
- 🐶 Sidekick: one overly attached dog who thinks "personal space" is a myth.
- 💬 Always down to chat about clean code, dirty trails, and everything in between.
